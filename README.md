My Textbook
---

I am currently writing a textbook on Quantum Mechanics. This is mainly to help
me study and to encourage me studying QM topics *outside* lecture to give me an
overall better understanding of the subject. Also I like the idea of having
textbooks I have written on a shelf of mine someday. 

The main .pdf of the textbook is `my_book/main.pdf`.  `/main.nb`
is the mathematica file for generating the figures. The rest of the `.tex`
files are for organizing the chapters before compilation.
